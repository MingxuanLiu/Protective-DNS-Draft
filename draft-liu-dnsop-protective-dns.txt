           Considerations for Protective DNS Server Operators
                 draft-liu-dnsop-protective-dns-latest

Abstract

   Protective DNS identifies whether domain names should be blocked
   based on the match results of its maintained blocklist.  For domain
   names in the blocklist, it rewrites DNS resolution responses to point
   to secure destinations (e.g., safe servers) to prevent users from
   accessing malicious entities.

   Owing to its effective defenses, Protective DNS deployment has surged
   through various efforts.  Not only have renowned DNS resolution
   service providers adopted this defense, but some nations have also
   launched national-scale deployments.  Concurrently, studies have
   attempted to analyze Protective DNS, identifying a series of
   implementation inconsistencies.

   Thus, this document aims to provide specific operational and security
   considerations for Protective DNS.  It is intended primarily for
   entities seeking to deploy Protective DNS for defensive purposes,
   offering concrete deployment recommendations.

1.  Introduction

   Protective DNS (also termed PDNS) is a lightweight defensive measure
   deployed at recursive resolvers.  PDNS proactively rewrites DNS
   resolution responses for malicious domains to safe destinations,
   thereby preventing users from accessing malicious resources.
   Specifically, when a client initiates a domain name resolution
   request, PDNS first performs a security check on the target
   domainâ€”determining whether the domain poses a security risk by
   matching it against blocklists.  If the domain is identified as
   malicious, PDNS uses DNS rewriting technology to intercept the
   resolution request and return a secure response (e.g., a safe server
   address controlled by the PDNS service provider), blocking users from
   establishing connections with malicious resources.  For legitimate
   domains, PDNS queries authoritative servers for responses and returns
   normal response to the client.

   The defensive benefits offered by PDNS have spurred extensive
   deployment efforts.  Renowned DNS resolution service providers have
   increasingly deployed PDNS on their recursive servers.  Moreover,
   some countries or regions have initiated national-level
   infrastructure deployments of PDNS.  For instance, the UK's National
   Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), launched a PDNS service in 2017 to
   enhance cyber defenses.  This service has been authorized for use by
   central government departments, local authorities, schools, and
   emergency services [UK-NCSC-PDNS].  Notably, statistics from the UK
   NCSC indicate that approximately 7.2 million individual users
   utilized the system in 2023 [UK-NCSC-PDNS-Usage].  In 2022, PDNS
   processed 810 billion DNS queries and blocked 11 billion queries
   involving 420,000 domains, accounting for approximately 2% of all
   queries [UK-Defence].

   As the deployment of PDNS continues to grow, efforts have been made
   to systematically analyze PDNS services, including deployment status,
   operational mechanism and security implications [USENIX24], [NDSS24].
   Existing work, through active probing of PDNS services, has revealed
   that 9% of stable recursive resolvers deploy PDNS (in 2023) [NDSS24].
   These implementations exhibit discrepancies among providers in terms
   of rewriting policies, blocklist selection and performance.
   Furthermore, security risks such as implementation flaws, over-
   blocking, and dangling resources have been identified, which may
   compromise the protective capabilities of certain PDNS deployments
   and even lead to severe risks such as denial of service.  Building on
   these findings, this document presents specific technical
   considerations spanning both operational and security aspects of
   PDNS.  These recommendations are targeted at all DNS providers
   offering Protective DNS services (including those operated by
   international ISPs, public DNS providers, etc.), aiming to provide
   practical deployment guidance that enhances both the usability and
   security of PDNS implementations.

   Notably, this document is primarily intended for readers familiar
   with Protective DNS technology and somewhat aware of the potential
   impacts that deploying such technologies may entail.  Moreover,
   existing documents [USENIX24], [SAC127] are recommended for legal
   considerations.  On this basis, this document focuses on discussing
   specific technical considerations at the deployment level.

3.  Background

3.1.  Overview of Protective DNS

   Protective DNS (PDNS) is deployed on a recursive resolver.  When the
   PDNS resolver receives a DNS query for a domain name, it first
   matches the domain against its maintained blocklist.  The resolver
   then makes a decision based on the blocklist lookup result.  If the
   domain is found in the blocklist, PDNS rewrites the DNS response to
   resolve the query to a "safe" result (e.g., IP address 127.0.0.1),
   effectively preventing the client from accessing the corresponding
   malicious resource.  Conversely, if the domain is not in the
   blocklist, the resolver returns a normal response by querying
   authoritative servers or using local cache results to respond to the
   client [RFC1034], [RFC1035].  Thus, the two functional components
   that underpin the critical role of PDNS are the Blocklist and the
   Rewriting Policy.

   *Blocklist.* The blocklist records a list of domain names for which
   the PDNS resolver performs resolution rewriting for defensive
   purposes.  Blocklist sources include multiple aspects: commercial
   threat intelligence (TI), open-source TI, vendor-maintained domain
   blocklists, and user complaints.  The types of malicious domains
   included in blocklists vary by vendor definition, encompassing but
   not limited to: malware, botnet command-and-control (C2), phishing,
   fraud, and adult content.

   Additionally, PDNS deployments implement blocklist lookup in two
   primary forms:

   1.  Local Lookup: storing directly on the PDNS server, allowing
       direct queries against the local blocklist file.

   2.  Remote Lookup: performing lookups via network interfaces (e.g.,
       DNSBL [RFC5782]).

   *Rewriting Policy.* Upon retrieving blocklist matching results, the
   PDNS server should rewrite resolution responses for domains marked as
   malicious targets.  The rewriting policy is critical to PDNS's
   defensive capability.  Primary implementations of the rewriting
   module include, but are not limited to:

   1.  DNS Response Policy Zones (RPZ) [RPZ]: Implemented as zone files
       [RFC1034], [RFC1035], specifying both whether rewriting is
       required and providing domain-specific rewrite results.

   2.  Domain Lists: This format consists of one domain per line,
       specifying only the rewrite requirement for each domain.

   Additionally, rewriting strategies exist in multiple forms.  Based on
   empirical analysis of leading Protective DNS vendors, this document
   summarizes five specific rewriting policies.

   1) Using the secure IP addresses in A record controlled by the
   provider:

       malicious_domain.com    A    10    controled_IP;

   2) Using IP addresses with special purposes, such as the reserved
   address like 0.0.0.0, link local address like 192.168.0.1, loopback
   addresses like 127.0.0.1, and so on:

       malicious_domain.com    A    10    127.0.0.1;

   3) Utilizing the CNAME record to rewrite the request to the domain
   name controlled by the provider:

       malicious_domain.com    CNAME    10    controled_domain.com;

   4) Using an empty Answer field in the response to prevent users from
   accessing malicious resources:

   *Deployment Practices.* Leading DNS providers have increasingly
   offered Protective DNS services.  For example, Cloudflare operates
   standard DNS services on 1.1.1.1, while PDNS servers on 1.1.1.2 and
   1.1.1.3 provide differentiated protection: 1) 1.1.1.2 focuses on
   malware defense; 2) 1.1.1.3 defends against both malware and adult
   content.  Additionally, recognizing the defensive efficacy of PDNS,
   nations including the U.S.  [US-Protect], U.K.  [UK-NCSC-PDNS], and
   Europe [DNS4EU] have designated PDNS as critical defensive
   infrastructure for national-level deployments, with details shown in
   Deployment Status.

3.2.  Distinctions of Protective DNS Technology

   Protective DNS constitutes a subset of DNS Blocking (generally
   considered as synonymous with DNS Filtering [SAC127]), sharing the
   goal of security defense by leveraging known blocklists (e.g., domain
   blacklists) to prevent user exposure to malicious resources.  DNS
   Blocking is a broader security concept encompassing any rewriting
   operations of DNS resolution traffic to restrict access to specific
   domains.  Its applicability spans diverse scenarios and architectural
   layers, specifically including defense at any DNS resolution role
   (stub in client, recursive resolver, authoritative server) and other
   security use scenarios (e.g., spam filtering, gateway firewall
   protection).  In contrast, PDNS represents a specific implementation
   of DNS Blocking, typically deployed on recursive resolvers.

   Several prior documents define specific techniques within DNS
   Blocking:

   1.  DNS Blacklist (DNSBL)[RFC5782]: DNSBL represents a DNS-based
       blacklist lookup technology, serving as a concrete implementation
       of blocklist lookup within the broader DNS Blocking paradigm
       (including PDNS).  First, it maintains blacklists of IP addresses
       or domain names associated with malicious activities.  Then, it
       utilizes DNS queries to determine whether to block related
       traffic.

   2.  DNS Response Policy Zones (RPZ) [RPZ]: Beyond remote blocklist
       querying (e.g., DNSBL), local deployment offers another blocklist
       deployment strategy.  RPZ achieves localized blocklist query via
       a zone file containing rewrite instructions for each malicious
       domain, often utilized in scenarios such as DNS Firewall.  RPZ
       supports multiple triggering mechanisms.  Among these, QNAME
       triggering is the primary mode adopted by PDNS.

   Another similar security concept is censorship.  While censorship
   shares the objective with DNS blocking, i.e., preventing end users
   from accessing specific resources, its blocking strategies are far
   more diverse.  Domain blacklist-based blocking represents just one
   type of DNS-layer mitigation, alongside techniques such as DNS
   poisoning.  Cross-layer mechanisms at network layers include TCP
   reset (e.g., sending forged RST packets), IP blocking, HTTPS man-in-
   the-middle attacks, and Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) for payload
   analysis.

   Additionally, as the Domain Name System serves as the starting point
   for most network activities, domain-based defense mechanisms have
   become one of the primary approaches to countering cyberattacks.
   Defense mechanisms at the domain level are diverse, with blocking
   actions occurring across various roles in the domain ecosystem.
   During the initial domain registration process, registries and
   registrars can use domain seizure to remove malicious domains from
   registration data, thereby preventing their continued harm to users.
   Registries and registrars can also employ sinkhole technology to
   redirect some malicious domains to domain black holes.  The
   Protective DNS defense mechanism addressed in this document is
   primarily deployed on recursive resolvers.

4.  Deployment Status

   Due to the significant protective efficacy of Protective DNS,
   existing academic efforts have evaluated its deployment status
   through measurement.  The results indicate a growing adoption trend
   of PDNS across large-scale DNS service providers, operational
   recursive resolvers in the wild, and national-level deployments.

   Existing work, by combining surveys of publicly available
   documentation from widely adopted DNS service providers with active
   testing, confirms that two-thirds of public DNS providers already
   offer Protective DNS services.  Notably, practices vary significantly
   across vendors, including differences in the types of malicious
   domains defended against and rewrite policies.  In terms of
   deployment strategies, the majority of vendors employ hybrid
   deployments, providing both Protective DNS and regular DNS resolution
   on a single resolver IP address, such as Comodo DNS and OpenDNS.  A
   smaller subset deploys Protective DNS and regular DNS resolution on
   separate resolver IPs, and in some cases, even different resolver
   servers from the same vendor may defend against distinct types of
   malicious domains.  For example, Cloudflare operates standard DNS
   services on 1.1.1.1, while PDNS servers on 1.1.1.2 and 1.1.1.3
   implement differentiated protection: 1) 1.1.1.2 focuses on malware
   defense; 2) 1.1.1.3 defends against both malware and adult content.

   Furthermore, existing studies using active scanning of the IPv4
   address space in 2023 confirm that approximately 9% of stable
   recursive resolvers have deployed Protective DNS capabilities,
   covering almost two-thirds of the world's countries.  By analyzing
   the types of malicious domains defended against, research has found
   that malware, botnet, phishing, and spam are the most common
   categories, with observable blocklist overlap across different
   recursive resolution services.  In terms of rewrite policies, using
   safe IP addresses and specialized IP addresses represents the most
   prevalent rewriting approach.

   Additionally, several countries and regions have even deployed
   national Protective DNS projects, including:

   1.  DNS4EU [DNS4EU]ï¼šLaunched in January 2023 under the auspices of
       the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA), this
       initiative serves as an alternative to prevailing public DNS
       resolution services.  It is designed to deliver protective,
       privacy-compliant, and resilient DNS capabilities, thereby
       enhancing the EU's digital sovereignty and security.  Any device
       connected to DNS4EU resolvers that attempts to access a malicious
       domain (e.g., hosting malware or related to phishing content) is
       immediately blocked, preventing potential harm.  Leveraging real-
       time threat monitoring and defense mechanisms, the project
       ensures that malicious domains identified in one EU jurisdiction
       are countered across multiple member states to contain their
       spread.  DNS4EU provides DNS security assurances to critical
       sectors including EU citizens, public institutions, government
       entities, and operators, while also supporting voluntary adoption
       or opt-out by EU residents.

   2.  PDNS in UK [UK-Defence]ï¼šSupported by the UK's National Cyber
       Security Centre (NCSC), this initiative advises private
       enterprises and government agencies to adopt Protective DNS to
       safeguard their IT assets and network security.  By blocking
       access to known malicious domains, it significantly reduces the
       effectiveness of ransomware, phishing, botnet, and malware
       attacks.  According to NCSC statistics, in 2022, the project's
       PDNS service processed 810 billion DNS queries and blocked 11
       billion queries involving 420 thousand distinct domains
       [UK-Defence].

   3.  PDNS in US [US-Protect]ï¼šThis initiative, launched by the
       Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) in 2022,
       is designed to provide security safeguards for the United States'
       national critical infrastructure.  The project protects the
       federal government by blocking network traffic at the DNS
       resolution layer from reaching potentially malicious
       destinations, enhancing resilience against intrusions and
       attacks.  When Protective DNS detects a DNS request matching
       threat intelligence indicators, the service blocks, redirects, or
       sinks the query response to a secure endpoint, while sending
       alerts to the source agency and CISA.  The initiative mandates
       the use of this Protective DNS service by all Federal Civil
       Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies and offers limited availability
       to infrastructure participants in pilot programs.

5.  Operational Considerations

   Considering that deployment is the first step in using and even
   maintaining the security of Protective DNS, in this section, we
   propose a series of operational considerations that cover multiple
   aspects of deployment practice, including blocklist selection,
   rewriting strategy construction, performance impact assessment, and
   explanatory offering

5.1.  Operational Consideration 1: Blocklist Selection

   One of the necessary conditions for Protective DNS to achieve its
   defensive capability is to maintain a blocklist that includes a
   series of malicious domain names to be blocked.

   First, Protective DNS operators need to construct a blocklist.  On
   one hand, they should choose the Blocklist sources, such as open-
   source threat intelligence, commercial threat feeds, self-collected
   malicious domains, and user feedback.  On the other hand, they should
   specify the types of malicious domains to block, including but not
   limited to malware, botnet, phishing, spam, tracking, and adult
   content.  Most importantly, operators should verify the correctness
   of these malicious domains to avoid false positives that could impact
   access to legitimate domains.

   Second, PDNS operators should select an appropriate blocklist
   deployment approach based on operational context (including device
   resource constraints and network access patterns) and application
   scenarios, such as deploying in RPZ format on resolvers or using
   network interfaces for remote querying.  Remote querying approaches
   require proactive consideration of potential privacy implications and
   impacts from network instability.  Local deployments necessitate a
   thorough assessment of local resource limitations.  Specifically, the
   Blocklist scale deployed on Protective DNS should be carefully
   defined based on the system's processing capability.  Blocklist size
   directly affects both the response efficiency of Protective DNS and
   hardware resource consumption (e.g., CPU, memory) on the hosting
   device.

   Most critically, operators should strive to avoid controversial
   blocklist formats to minimize the impact of potential false
   positives.  First, PDNS should refrain from using keywords as
   Blocklist entries, as this exacerbates the likelihood of introducing
   false positives and undermines PDNS availability.  Second, PDNS
   providers should avoid using wildcard domains in Blocklists, as such
   practices may also lead to false positives.  To maximize the
   mitigation of false positives, mitigation at the minimum subdomain
   granularity (i.e., FQDN) may minimize collateral damage.

5.2.  Operational Consideration 2 - Rewriting Policy Construction

   Based on empirical analyses of popular Protective DNS providers, five
   primary rewriting approaches have been identified in practice: 1)
   Using safe IP addresses controlled by the PDNS provider; 2) Employing
   specialized IP addresses (e.g., reserved loopback addresses like
   127.0.0.1); 3) Rewriting requests to PDNS provider-controlled domains
   via CNAME records; 4) Sending responses with empty Answer sections;
   5) Returning special response codes (e.g., NXDomain, ServerFail).
   Each rewriting strategy caters to specific security scenarios,
   requiring providers to select appropriate approaches based on their
   application requirements, specifically as follows:

   1) Secure IP addresses: Under this policy, the rewritten target
   address is a server controlled by the PDNS provider, enabling PDNS
   providers to monitor traffic.  Specifically, the controlled server
   acts as a "honeypot" managed by the provider, capturing DNS traffic
   of malicious domain names for further analysis of threat behaviors
   (e.g., malware communications).  However, this approach incurs
   operational overhead for PDNS providers, who need to actively monitor
   the status of these servers.  Additionally, this scenario
   necessitates consideration of privacy risks arising from traffic
   monitoring.

   2) Specialized IP addresses: Due to the non-routable nature of these
   IP addresses on public networks, they are better suited for scenarios
   with strict privacy protection requirements, such as when users do
   not want any third parties to track their network behavior.  However,
   PDNS operators should consider potential risks when using these
   specialized IP addresses.  For example: a) 192.168.0.1 is typically
   used for local area network devices.  Such configurations may lead to
   unintended access to internal network devices if clients mistakenly
   connect to them; b) 127.0.0.1 is commonly used for local inter-
   process communication.  Redirecting to this address may cause clients
   to attempt to connect to local services, which could be exploited if
   vulnerabilities existâ€”such as through port scanning or service
   spoofing.  This is particularly risky when users mistake local
   services for external ones, potentially exposing sensitive
   information or enabling attacks.  Additionally, this approach lacks
   transparency for users in the event of false positives, as it cannot
   provide explanatory feedback, which is discussed in detail in the
   Security Considerations.

   3) Secure CNAME: This strategy, similar to using controlled IP
   addresses, enables providers to dynamically monitor traffic.
   However, providers should remain vigilant against dangling resource
   record risks arising from improper management, details of which are
   discussed in Security Considerations.

   4) Empty Answer Section: This strategy represents a minimalist
   rewriting approach, simply returning an empty answer section.
   However, it undermines the transparency of PDNS services for users
   and may escalate to more aggressive implementationsâ€”such as refusing
   to return resolution responsesâ€” which entail denial-of-response risks
   detailed in the Security Considerations.

   5) Special Response Codes (Rcodes): This strategy is compatible with
   regular DNS error scenarios, which help prevent malware from
   detecting the defensive mechanisms of PDNS.  However, such practices
   may also undermine the transparency of Protective DNS services,
   making it difficult for users to understand the rationale behind
   rewriting actions.

   Second, PDNS operators should consider the impact of TTL
   configurations and appropriately configure the TTL values for
   rewritten records.  On one hand, an overly long TTL may lead to
   delayed updates of defense strategies for malicious domains.  On the
   other hand, a too-short TTL triggers frequent DNS queries, increasing
   PDNS server load and potentially degrading performance.

5.3.  Operational Consideration 3 - Performance Impact

   As Protective DNS services introduce an additional query step whether
   a domain is malicious during standard DNS resolution, operators
   should anticipate potential impacts on DNS resolution performance.
   Specifically, factors such as blocklist deployment method (remote vs.
   local), scale, and domain matching techniques (e.g., hash matching)
   can affect performance.  Experimental results show that loading a
   blocklist into memory with five million malicious domains can still
   be maintained within 10-second response times, but exceeding this
   scale may result in loading times exceeding 10 seconds, leading to
   unacceptable performance impacts.

5.4.  Operational Consideration 4 - Offering Explanation

   Protective DNS operates as a complete black-box service for users.
   Regardless of the rewriting strategy employed, users only perceive
   the blocking effectâ€”i.e., the inability to access a domain.  While
   providers can refine blocklist quality to minimize false positives,
   the inevitable presence of false positives significantly degrades
   user experience.  Users may encounter unexplained domain
   inaccessibility that is indistinguishable from prevalent DNS
   tampering (e.g., censorship, man-in-the-middle attacks).  Therefore,
   providing clear explanations for Protective DNS actions can enhance
   usability.  Operators should anticipate that omitted explanations may
   lead users to misperceive service instability or even switch to
   competing DNS providers.

   This explanation of PDNS can be realized through multiple approaches.
   First, to indicate that blocking originates from Protective DNS,
   service providers may offer a dedicated landing page to explain their
   protective services, helping users confirm that the observed DNS
   rewriting originates from the providerâ€™s Protective DNS.  Empirical
   analyses show some PDNS providers redirect DNS queries to a secure IP
   address hosting a page that notifies users of potential malicious
   website access.  However, using a provider-controlled IP introduces
   risks of dangling resource takeover, detailed in Security
   Consideration.  Second, the EDE (Extended DNS Error) [RFC8914],
   [Structered-Error] protocol can be employed to specify in the
   extension fields that rewriting results from Protective DNS defense
   against malicious domains.

   Moreover, providing user appeal channels on explanation pages, such
   as an email address, could mitigate negative impacts of potential
   false positives.

6.  Security Considerations

   Furthermore, by integrating the operational considerations, we
   propose security considerations to enhance the security of Protective
   DNS on the basis of improving its practicality.  We outline specific
   considerations covering multiple dimensions.  For each factor, we
   provide specific recommended mitigations, including policy flaws,
   over-blocking, dangling resource risks, compatibility with other
   security practices and fault diagnosis.

6.1.  Security Consideration 1 - Policy Flaw

   To prevent flaws in the protection function or even bypassing,
   service providers should consider the following three aspects.

   *Redundant Rdata.* According to measurements of Protective DNS
   services, the configurations of Rdata in rewritten records by some
   providers have defects.  Specifically, along with the rewritten
   records, several PDNS providers may also include the original
   malicious records in the DNS response.  For local stub resolvers of
   users, the selection of the resolution result is uncontrollable, and
   users still have a high probability of accessing malicious resources.
   Therefore, Protective DNS providers should avoid such redundant
   configurations to ensure the completeness of the defense
   effectiveness.

   *Missing Record type.* While A records are the most common type of
   DNS resolution and are often the primary focus of defensive
   configuration by service providersâ€”since they directly point users to
   malicious resourcesâ€”empirical measurements have revealed that some
   Protective DNS providers fail to protect less common query types,
   such as TXT records.  In these cases, the provider may return
   original responses, potentially exposing users to hidden threats.
   This oversight could be exploited to bypass PDNS protections,
   particularly when malicious domains embed harmful instructions within
   less scrutinized record types.  Therefore, PDNS providers should
   proactively consider the potential impacts of missing record type
   configurations.

   *Policy Coverage.* In addition to the defensive configuration of the
   response results, Protective DNS providers should ensure that the
   defensive functions are effective in all functional scenario.
   Specifically, encrypted DNS should also have the same defensive
   effect as non-encrypted DNS, to prevent malicious domain names from
   bypassing the defense by merely using encrypted DNS.  Additionally,
   IPv6 scenarios should also be considered.

6.2.  Security Consideration 2 - Dangling Resources

   Some Protective DNS providers use self-controlled domains or IPs as
   rewriting strategies.  However, mismanagement of these rewritten
   resources may lead to takeover risks from Dangling Resources,
   specifically:

   1.  If the rewritten IP is a cloud service IP, obsolete cloud IP
       addresses pose a takeover risk.

   2.  If the rewritten CNAME domain expires, there is an expired domain
       takeover risk.

   3.  If the rewritten CNAME domain belongs to a third-party service,
       subdomain takeover risks may arise.

   Upon gaining control of vulnerable rewritten resources (e.g., those
   at risk of expiration), attackers can trigger DNS queries for
   malicious domains to the compromised Protective DNS server via
   phishing tactics.  They can then return modified malicious content to
   victims, enabling connections between victims and attacker servers.

   Therefore, Protective DNS service providers should exercise due
   diligence when using third-party network resources.  On one hand,
   they should consider the financial and management costs of regular
   maintenance of these resources.  On the other hand, they need to
   periodically verify the status of these third-party services to avoid
   dangling resource risks.

6.3.  Security Consideration 3 - Over-Blocking

   Protective DNS rewriting should minimize the impact of over-blocking,
   as this introduces significant collateral damage in two primary
   aspects.

   *Blocklist Construction.* First, Protective DNS service providers
   should avoid errors in blocklists, as blocklist errors directly cause
   collateral damage to benign domain names.  Second, over-generalizing
   target domains for blocking in Protective DNS may also lead to
   collateral damage.  Using keywords as blocklist entries exacerbates
   the likelihood of false positives, causing unintended blocking of
   benign domains and degrading PDNS availability.  Employing wildcard
   domains in blocklists similarly introduces false positives.
   Meanwhile, blocking at the second-level domain (SLD) or top-level
   domain (TLD) levels can also trigger false positivesâ€”for example,
   cloud services often host user-specific services on subdomains, so
   blocking the apex domain of such a cloud service would impact
   numerous unrelated services.  Thus, blocking at the fully qualified
   domain names (FQDNs) could minimize collateral damage.  Finally,
   providers should promptly update blocklists to avoid false positives
   from delayed updates.

   *Blocking Policy.* The primary defense objective of Protective DNS is
   to prevent users from accessing any malicious resources, i.e.,
   intercepting as many malicious domains as possible.  However,
   empirical analysis has shown that some Protective DNS implementations
   exhibit over-blocking collateral damage from aggressive blocking.
   Measurements reveal that certain Protective DNS services apply
   extreme defensive strategies to queries for one or more malicious
   domains, temporarily blocking all domain resolution for the
   clientâ€”including legitimate domains.  This introduces denial-of-
   response (DoR) risks, as attackers can exploit this behavior to
   impose DoR attacks on arbitrary victims.  Specifically, sending a set
   of malicious domain queries with spoofed source IP addresses can
   force the victimâ€™s client to lose all DNS resolution capabilities,
   effectively executing a denial-of-service attack.

   Therefore, PDNS service providers should exercise caution when
   implementing aggressive defensive strategies and consider the
   potential impact of such approaches in advance.  Meanwhile,
   Protective DNS providers should preconfigure defense mechanisms
   against potential denial-of-resolution (DoR) risks.  Specifically,
   when a client initiates a large volume of DNS queries exceeding a
   defined threshold for malicious domains to a Protective DNS server,
   providers should evaluate the impact of directly blocking all DNS
   query responses from the client for a period of time.  To effectively
   mitigate denial-of-response attacks, providers can send oversized DNS
   responses to enforce TCP fallback, thereby thwarting DoR attacks
   constructed via IP spoofing.

6.4.  Security Consideration 4 - Compatibility with other security
      practices

   Protective DNS may interact with other security practices in the DNS
   architecture, such as DNSSEC [RFC4033].  Under normal circumstances,
   DNSSEC primarily operates between recursive resolvers and
   authoritative servers.  For Protective DNS, when a malicious domain
   matches the blocklist, if the PDNS server does not query the
   authoritative server for DNSSEC records, the mutual impact between
   PDNS and DNSSEC remains limited.  However, PDNS service providers
   should consider scenarios where clients instruct PDNS servers to
   perform DNSSEC validation by setting the DO bit for blocked malicious
   domainsâ€”such as by setting the DO (DNSSEC OK) bit [RFC4035].  In such
   cases, PDNS rewriting protection may affect the normal operation of
   DNSSEC.Therefore, PDNS service providers should proactively assess
   the mutual impacts between PDNS services and other security
   practices.

6.5.  Security Consideration 5 - Fault Diagnosis

   As Protective DNS introduces new components, such as blocklists,
   service providers should consider fault diagnosis for denial-of-
   service (DoS) failures in individual components and corresponding
   fallback mechanisms to ensure performance stability.  For example, in
   scenarios involving remote blocklist queries, providers should
   proactively diagnose the availability of remote blocklist interfaces
   on a regular basis.  If remote blocklist query services become
   unavailable due to network issues or other causes, and no fallback
   mechanism is in place, this may render the providerâ€™s DNS query
   services inoperable.  Thus, providers should predefine fallback
   mechanismsâ€”such as reverting to normal DNS resolution procedures.
