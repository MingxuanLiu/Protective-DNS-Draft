           Considerations for Protective DNS Server Operators
                 draft-liu-dnsop-protective-dns-latest

Abstract

   Recent research work has delved deeply into a new type of DNS
   security service, Protective DNS, through various measurement
   methods, and it has been deployed in multiple DNS providers and even
   in national ISPs.  Protective DNS identifies whether the domain names
   requested by customers are in the threat intelligence (blocklist) it
   maintains.  For domain names listed in the blocklist, it rewrites the
   resolution results to secure resources to prevent users from
   accessing malicious resources, such as malicious servers (IP
   addresses), etc.  This document summarizes the conclusions of these
   research works and provides specific and practical considerations and
   suggestions for the deployment and operation of Protective DNS.  By
   following these considerations, Protective DNS service providers can
   effectively enhance the practicality and security of their services.

1.  Introduction

   Currently, 90% of cyber attack activities originate from domain name
   resolution [Cisco].  Therefore, the approach of blocking unintended
   network resource interactions based on the Domain Name System (DNS)
   has become a crucial network defense measure.  DNS Filter [RPZ] is
   the most common blocking method in the DNS.  For domain names that
   match the blocklist, it prevents access to unintended (especially
   malicious) network resources by rewriting their DNS responses, that
   is, rewriting the resolution results of these domain names to a
   securely controlled host instead of the original host address.
   Considering that this method can intercept attacks at the initial
   stage, it is commonly referred to as Protective DNS and has been
   deployed and implemented by multiple national governments and DNS
   vendors [DNS4EU], [US-Protect], [Canada-Protect].

   Recent research has explored the current deployment status and
   security properties of Protective DNS.  This document summarizes the
   conclusions of these studies.  These security considerations are
   applicable to all DNS resolvers that offer Protective DNS services
   (including DNS resolvers of international ISPs and well-known DNS
   resolution servers), aiming to provide practical deployment
   suggestions for Protective DNS service providers and effectively
   enhance the availability and security of this service.

3.  Background

   As the Domain Name System (DNS) serves as the starting point for most
   network activities [RFC1034], [RFC1035], the defense mechanisms based
   on domain names have become one of the main approaches to defend
   against cyberattacks.  The defense mechanisms at the domain name
   level are extremely diverse, and the nodes where blocking actions
   occur can be found among various domain name roles.  For example, in
   the initial process of domain name registration, the registry and the
   registrar can use the method of Domain Seizure to delete malicious
   domain names from the registration data, thus preventing them from
   causing further harm.  The Protective DNS defense mechanism that this
   document focuses on is implemented based on the DNS Filter
   [Error-Filter] technology and is mainly deployed on recursive
   servers.  Since recursive servers are closer to the user side
   (compared with authoritative servers, registries, and registrars),
   the defensive effect of deploying this mechanism on recursive servers
   is more obvious, which is also the main focus of this document.

                 Figure 1: The workflow of Protective DNS.

   Figure 1 shows the workflow of Protective DNS.  First, when the
   Protective DNS resolver receives a DNS query request for domain name
   A, it will match this domain name against the blocklist [RFC5782] it
   maintains.  Subsequently, once the domain name is found in the
   blocklist, Protective DNS will rewrite its DNS response, that is,
   resolve the query to a series of "safe" results (such as the safe IP
   address 127.0.0.1), thus effectively preventing clients from
   accessing the corresponding malicious resources.  Conversely, if the
   queried domain name is not in the blocklist, a normal response will
   be returned.  That is, it will query the authoritative server or use
   the locally cached results for the response.

   Through investigation, 28 out of 42 popular DNS providers have
   already offered Protective DNS services, which run on a total of 155
   resolver IP addresses [NDSS24], [USENIX24].  Among them, 8 providers
   support Protective DNS services and non-Protective DNS services on
   different resolver addresses respectively.  For example, Cloudflare's
   Protectgive DNS service runs on 1.1.1.2 and 1.1.1.3, while 1.1.1.1
   provides the original DNS service.  At the same time, considering the
   defensive effectiveness of Protective DNS, countries and regions such
   as the United States [US-Protect], the United Kingdom [DNS4EU], and
   Canada [Canada-Protect] have listed Protective DNS as a defense
   infrastructure for national-level deployment and application.

   The defense strategies implemented by Protective DNS are diverse.
   The specific rewriting strategies mainly include secure IP addresses
   controlled by the providers, special-use IPs (e.g., 127.0.0.1),
   secure CNAMEs, responding with specific Response Codes (e.g.,
   NXDomain, ServerFail), and providing an Empty Answer.  Meanwhile,
   different providers' Protective DNS services focus on different types
   of malicious content, including advertisements, trackers, malware,
   phishing, and adult content.

   Protective DNS is implemented based on DNS Filter technology.  The
   two protocols most closely related to it are as follows: 1) The [RPZ]
   protocol defines the response strategies of the DNS Filter, including
   the setting methods of the Root Zone and the response strategies;
   2)The [Error-Filter] defines the structural definitions for stating
   the filtering results and the reasons in the response.

   Although the application requirements and deployment practices of
   Protective DNS are increasingly growing, due to the lack of guidance
   suggestions for deployment, Protective DNS faces serious security
   flaws.  This document combines the conclusions of these research
   works with the measurement results to form some specific deployment
   suggestions, aiming to enhance the practicality and security of
   Protective DNS deployment.  In the subsequent chapters, we will
   summarize the conclusions from the academic papers obtained through
   the measurement methods into conclusions that are helpful for
   Protective DNS service providers as a reference.

4.  Operational Considerations

   Considering that deployment practice is the first step in using and
   even maintaining the security of Protective DNS, in this section, we
   propose a series of operational considerations that cover multiple
   aspects of deployment practice, including rewriting strategies,
   defense strategies, and transparency.

4.1.  Operational Consideration 1 - Select an appropriate rewriting
      mechanism

   The most crucial aspect for Protective DNS to achieve its defensive
   capability is to adopt the rewriting strategy for DNS filtering to
   prevent users from accessing malicious resources.  Through
   summarizing the empirical analysis of popular Protective DNS
   providers and generalizing the DNS Filter technology, there are
   mainly five types of rewritings that occur in practice:

   1) Using the secure IP addresses in A record controlled by the
   provider:

       malicious_domain.com    A    10    controled_IP;

   2) Using IP addresses with special purposes, such as the reserved
   address like 127.0.0.1, 0.0.0.0, 192.168.0.1 and so on:

       malicious_domain.com    A    10    127.0.0.1;

   3) Utilizing the CNAME record to rewrite the request to the domain
   name controlled by the provider:

       malicious_domain.com    CNAME    10    controled_domain.com;

   4) Using an empty Answer field in the response to prevent users from
   accessing malicious resources:

4.2.  Operational Consideration 2 - Provider an appropriate blocklist
      for defense

   A necessary condition for Protective DNS to achieve its defensive
   capability is to construct a blocklist that includes a series of
   malicious domain names to be blocked.  The structural components of
   the domain name blocking list are as described in [RPZ].  Through the
   empirical analysis of popular Protective DNS vendors, these vendors
   currently mainly focus on a series of items related to
   advertisements, privacy tracking, malware, phishing, and adult
   content.

   First, through the analysis of users of Protective DNS, Protective
   DNS providers SHOULD avoid using keywords for domain filtering,
   because this will increase the possibility of introducing false
   positives, which will affect the availability of Protective DNS.

   Second, Protective DNS providers SHOULD avoid using wildcard blocking
   methods and should carry out defense at the granularity of the
   minimum subdomain (that is, the Fully Qualified Domain Name), so that
   the collateral damage caused can be minimized.

   Finally, from the perspective of operational efficiency, the scale of
   the blocklist deployed on the Protective DNS SHOULD be carefully
   selected.  It should not only avoid false positives but also choose
   an appropriate scale, as the scale of the blocklist will affect the
   response efficiency of the Protective DNS and the consumption of
   hardware resources of the device (such as CPU and memory).

4.3.  Operational Consideration 3 - Offer transparent blocking policies

   Protective DNS is a completely black-box service for users.
   Regardless of the rewriting strategy adopted by Protective DNS, users
   can only perceive the effect of defensive blocking, that is, the
   domain name cannot be accessed.  Although Protective DNS providers
   can refine and improve the quality of the blocklist (filtering out
   false positives as much as possible), the existence of false
   positives that slip through the net can still severely damage the
   user experience.  From the user's perspective, the website they want
   to access is inexplicably inaccessible, and it is difficult to
   distinguish from a large number of DNS tampering behaviors on the
   network (such as censorship, man-in-the-middle hijacking, etc.).
   Therefore, from the perspective of enhancing the availability of
   Protective DNS, we recommend that providers MUST ensure transparency
   as much as possible.

   On the one hand, to demonstrate that the blocking action originates
   from the Protective DNS, the service provider SHOULD provide a page
   to explain their rewriting strategy.  In the results of the empirical
   analysis, we found that some providers rewrite by using a secure IP
   address and deploy a page on this IP address to indicate that the
   website the user is accessing may be malicious.  However, using an IP
   address controlled by the service provider poses potential security
   risks, specifically the risk of Dangling resource takeover, which is
   elaborated in Security Consideration 3.  Therefore, it is advisable
   for the service provider to use a dedicated page (this page should be
   explicitly deployed on the page provided by the service) to
   illustrate their defense strategy, helping users confirm that the DNS
   rewriting they encounter may be from the Protective DNS service
   provided by this provider.

   On the other hand, to avoid the impact of false positives, service
   providers SHOULD provide users with an appeal channel on the
   explanatory page, such as providing an email address.  Through the
   analysis of the measurement results of academic papers, only 14
   Protective DNS deploy explanatory pages on the secure IP addresses
   used for defense.

5.  Security Considerations

   Furthermore, by integrating the operational considerations, we
   propose some security considerations to enhance the security of
   Protective DNS on the basis of improving its practicality.  We put
   forward specific considerations covering multiple dimensions, and for
   each consideration factor, we provide specific recommended solutions,
   including aspects such as security blocking strategies, rewriting
   strategies, and privacy protection.

5.1.  Security Consideration 1 - Avoid Improper Configuration

   To prevent the protection function from failing or even being
   bypassed, Protective DNS service providers need to fully configure
   the defense as much as possible, which mainly includes two aspects.

   *Avoid Redundant Configuration*. According to the measurement of
   Protective DNS services, the configurations of Protective DNS by some
   providers have defects.  Specifically, along with the secure
   rewriting records, providers may also include the original malicious
   records in the DNS response.  For the local stub resolver of users,
   the selection of the resolution result is uncontrollable, and users
   still have a high possibility of accessing malicious resources.
   Therefore, Protective DNS providers SHOULD avoid such redundant
   configurations to ensure the completeness of the defense effect.

   *Avoid Configuration Gaps*. While A records are the most common type
   of DNS resolution and are often the primary focus for defensive
   configuration by service providers—since they directly point users to
   malicious resources—empirical measurements have revealed that some
   Protective DNS providers fail to secure less common query types, such
   as TXT records.  In these cases, the provider may return unfiltered
   responses, potentially exposing users to hidden threats.  This
   oversight could be exploited to bypass PDNS protections, particularly
   when malicious domains embed harmful instructions within less
   scrutinized record types.  Therefore, to ensure comprehensive
   defense, Protective DNS providers SHOULD configure defensive
   capabilities for all DNS record types, including TXT, MX, and others.
   However, situations such as DNSSEC also need to be considered, and
   detailed explanations can be found in Security Consideration 4.

   *Avoid Function Gaps*. In addition to the defensive configuration of
   the response results, Protective DNS service providers should ensure
   that the defensive functions are effective in any functional
   scenario.  Specifically, encrypted DNS should also have the same
   defensive effect as non-encrypted DNS, to prevent malicious domain
   names from bypassing the defense by merely using encrypted DNS.

5.2.  Security Consideration 2 - Avoid Over-Blocking

   The primary defense objective of Protective DNS is to prevent users
   from accessing any malicious resources, that is, to intercept as many
   malicious domain names as possible.  However, through practical
   analysis, some Protective DNS systems exhibit the phenomenon of over-
   blocking, which refers to the collateral damage caused by overly
   aggressive blocking.  In empirical measurement and analysis, it has
   been found that some Protective DNS services adopt overly aggressive
   defense strategies for DNS queries of a group (no less than one) of
   malicious domain names.  That is, they temporarily block the domain
   name resolution of all requests from a client, and even legitimate
   domain names cannot be resolved normally.  This phenomenon is called
   the Denial of Resolution (DoR) attack caused by Protective DNS.
   Attackers can exploit this phenomenon to cause a DoR effect on any
   victim.  Specifically, by forging the source address and sending a
   set of queries for malicious domain names, they can prevent the
   victim from normally completing any domain name resolution, thus
   achieving the effect of a denial-of-service attack.

   Therefore, Protective DNS service providers SHOULD avoid using
   aggressive defense strategies, such as the no-response strategy.  At
   the same time, Protective DNS providers MUST pre-configure defense
   solutions against potential DoR risks.  Specifically, when a client
   initiates a large number (higher than a certain threshold) of DNS
   query requests for malicious domain names to the Protective DNS
   server, the provider SHOULD NOT directly refuse to respond to any
   query requests for a certain period of time.  Instead, it should send
   a relatively large DNS response to force the client to use DNS over
   TCP, effectively preventing attackers from launching DoR attacks
   constructed through IP spoofing.

5.3.  Security Consideration 3 - Ensure Secure Resource Usage

   Out of considerations for controllability, most Protective DNS
   providers will adopt domain names or IP addresses under their control
   as a rewriting strategy.  However, improper management of these
   rewritten resources can expose serious security risks.  For instance,
   after a third-party attacker takes over rewritten resources with
   vulnerabilities (such as those with expiration risks) and gains
   control over these resources, the attacker can trigger query requests
   for malicious domain names from victims to the Protective DNS server
   whose resources are under the attacker's control through means like
   phishing, and return modified malicious content to the victims,
   thereby establishing a connection between the victims and the
   attacker's server.

   Therefore, Protective DNS should strive to avoid using third-party
   resources as its rewriting infrastructure, such as cloud services.
   Even when using third-party resources, it is essential to use them
   with caution and regularly confirm the availability status of these
   resources.

5.4.  Security Consideration 4 - Possess compatibility

   Since the defense mechanism implemented by Protective DNS requires
   rewriting the original DNS response content, this rewriting operation
   needs to ensure compatibility with other protocols and functions
   within the DNS architecture.  Specifically, the rewriting performed
   by Protective DNS should not conflict with the processing of DNSSEC
   as specified in [RFC4033].  This is because if the rewriting of the
   DNS response by Protective DNS does not follow certain
   specifications, it may interfere with the verification process of
   DNSSEC.  For example, if Protective DNS deletes or modifies DNSSEC-
   related records when rewriting the response, it may lead to the
   failure of DNSSEC verification.  Therefore, when Protective DNS
   rewrites the response, it should handle DNSSEC records correctly and
   maintain their integrity to avoid conflicts with the DNSSEC
   mechanism.  This item mainly focuses on DNSSEC-related records and
   does not conflict with Security Consideration 1.
